It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as common due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions.\nThe Standard consists of the following four key parts:\n\u2022\tA model Competent Authority Agreement (CAA), providing the international legal framework for the automatic exchange of CRS information;\n\u2022\tThe Common Reporting Standard;\n\u2022\tThe Commentaries on the CAA and the CRS; and\n\u2022\tThe CRS XML Schema User Guide.\u201d\nFor the purposes of the UAE CRS Regulations, the Common Reporting Standard Commentary and FAQs, which is any explanatory material made and published by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) for the purpose of assisting with the interpretation of the Common Reporting Standard, is an integral part of the Common Reporting Standard and accordingly applies for the purposes of the automatic exchange of financial account information.\nThe UAE Financial Institutions should consult documentation issued, from time to time, by the OECD for clarification and the CRS commentary and FAQs, for example:\n\u2022\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters\n\u2022\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters - Implementation Handbook\n\u2022\tCRS FAQs.\nThe above documents are published on the OECD website: http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ and https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/.",
