        "Passage": "An Authorised Person Managing a PSIA, on an unrestricted basis is subject to a unique type of risk referred to as Displaced Commercial Risk. This risk reflects the fact that an Authorised Person may find itself under commercial pressure to pay a rate of return to its PSIA holders which is sufficient to induce those investors to maintain the investment of their funds in an Unrestricted PSIA managed by the Authorised Person, rather than withdrawing those funds from the Unrestricted PSIA and investing them elsewhere. If this \"required\" rate of return is higher than that which would be payable under the normal terms of the PSIA Investment Contract, the Authorised Person may be under pressure to forgo some of the share of profit which would normally have been attributed to an Authorised Person and, by extension, be available for distribution to its shareholders (e.g. part of the Mudarib's share of the profits of a Mudaraba). Failure to do this might result in a volume of withdrawals of funds by investors large enough to jeopardise the Authorised Person's commercial position (or, in an extreme case, its solvency). Thus, part of the commercial risk attached to the returns attributable to the PSIA is, in effect, transferred to the shareholders of the Authorised Person or the Authorised Person's own capital.
