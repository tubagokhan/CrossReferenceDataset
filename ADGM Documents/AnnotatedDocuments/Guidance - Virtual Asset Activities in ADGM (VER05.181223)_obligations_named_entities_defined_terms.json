Below are the detailed descriptions of each:\n\nOther Digital Tokens: These are utility tokens which do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment/instrument under FSRA.\n\nVirtual Assets: This category includes non-fiat virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, etc. The figure notes that FSRA's market intermediaries conducting Virtual Asset business are required to apply and hold the relevant license under FSRA.\n\nDigital Securities: Described as digital assets with security characteristics, including 'tokenized' offerings of securities. Financial services activities in relation to Security Tokens - e.g., the offering of, dealing in, advising on, custody of, or providing Security Tokens - are regulated as Security instruments under FSRA.\n\nFiat Tokens: These are digital tokens that are fully backed by fiat currency. Some activities where tokens are used as payment instruments, e.g., stablecoins, may be regulated as Providing Money Services under FSRA.\n\nDerivatives/Funds: This refers to Derivatives over regulated Digital Assets and collective investment funds investing in Regulated Digital Assets. They are regulated as Derivatives and Funds in a Fund under FSRA.\n\nMarket operators and intermediaries dealing in such Derivatives and Funds are licensed and approved by FSRA.\n\nThe bottom note clarifies that the FSRA regulates and will allow to operate within the ADGM, the Digital Assets located within the blue dotted line and Derivatives over/Funds investing in Digital Assets. The blue dotted line encapsulates all categories except \"Other Digital Tokens,\" implying that all the other categories fall under the regulatory scope of FSRA within the ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market).\n/Figure End\n\n\n/Table Start\nCategory of Digital Assets / Instruments\tRegulatory Approach\n\u201cDigital Securities\u201d\n\n(e.g., digital/virtual tokens that have the features and characteristics of a Security under the FSMR (such as Shares, Debentures and Units in a Collective Investment Fund)).\nDeemed to be Securities pursuant to Paragraph 58(2)(b) of FSMR.\n\nAll financial services activities in relation to Digital Securities, such as operating primary / secondary markets, dealing / trading / managing investments in or advising on Digital Securities, are subject to the relevant regulatory requirements under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries and market operators dealing or managing investments in Digital Securities need to be licensed / approved by FSRA as FSP holders (including as Multilateral Trading Facilities), Recognised Investment Exchanges or Recognised Clearing Houses, as applicable.\n\n\u201cVirtual Assets\u201d\n\n(e.g., non-fiat virtual currencies,\ncrypto \u2018exchange tokens\u2019).\n\nAs stated in paragraph 9, this Guidance is primarily focused on Virtual Assets.\tTreated as commodities and, therefore, not deemed Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries (e.g., broker dealers, custodians, asset managers) dealing in or managing Virtual Assets, and Multilateral Trading Facilities using Virtual Assets, need to be licensed / approved by FSRA.  Only activities in Accepted Virtual Assets will be permitted.\n\nCapital formation activities are not provided for under the Virtual Asset Framework, and such activities are not envisaged under the Market Rules (MKT).\n\nDerivatives and Collective Investment Funds of Virtual Assets, Digital Securities and Utility Tokens\tRegulated as Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries and market operators dealing in such Derivatives and Collective Investment Funds will need to be licensed / approved by FSRA as FSP holders, Recognised Investment Exchanges or Recognised Clearing Houses, as applicable.\n\n\u201cUtility Tokens\u201d\n\n(e.g., tokens which can be redeemed for access to a specific product or service, typically provided using a DLT platform, do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment / instrument under the FSMR).\nTreated as commodities and, therefore, not deemed Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nUnless such Utility Tokens are caught as Accepted Virtual Assets, spot trading and transactions in Utility Tokens do not constitute Regulated Activities, activities envisaged under a Recognition Order (e.g., those of a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House), or activities envisaged under MKT.\n\n\n\u201cFiat Tokens\u201d\n\n(e.g., stablecoins whose value are fully backed by underlying fiat currencies)\tTreated as a form of digital representation of Fiat Currency.\n\nWhere used as a payment instrument for the purposes of Money Transmission as defined under the FSMR, the activity will be licensed and regulated as Providing Money Services.\n\n/Table End\n\n",

Virtual Asset systems can be accessed via the Internet (including via mobile phones), and can be used to make cross-border payments and fund transfers;\n\nc)\tVirtual Asset platforms commonly rely on complex infrastructures utilising several entities, often spanning multiple countries, to transfer funds or execute payments. This segmentation of services means that responsibility for ML/TF compliance and supervision/enforcement may be unclear. Moreover, Client and transaction records may be held by different entities, in different jurisdictions, making it more difficult for regulators and law enforcement agencies to access them.

This built upon previous FATF statements by clarifying a RBA for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (\u201cAML/CFT\u201d) purposes.   The basic principle underlying the FATF Guidelines is that VASPs are expected to \u201cidentify, assess, and take effective action to mitigate their ML/TF risks\u201d with respect to VAs.\n",

        "Passage": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nWhen considering the FATF Recommendations, in combination with the application of the AML Rules, the FSRA notes the following key principles that an Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets should consider:\n\na)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nFATF expects countries, regulators, financial institutions and other concerned parties to adopt a \u2018Risk Based Approach\u2019 (\u201cRBA\u201d). Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks. A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities. In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks. The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nOne of the most challenging risks facing financial institutions is how the on-boarding of an Authorised Person may affect its relationship with foreign correspondent financial institutions, as well as the views of the regulator of those foreign correspondent financial institutions. In essence, a foreign correspondent financial institution relationship is built on the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s ML compliance program and ongoing monitoring capabilities.\n\nd)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\nWith the use of cryptology and block chain technologies at a nascent stage within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out CDD on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\n\ne)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities. When identifying and assessing these risks, several factors should be considered, including an assessment of the use of new technologies.  Importantly, in the context of Virtual Assets, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n\u201cCountries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\u201d\n\nf)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Virtual Asset industry. Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Virtual Assets in criminal activities, as well as the technical and complicated nature of Virtual Assets (and the platforms they operate on).\n\ng)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\nWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks. For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to cyber security (e.g., when dealing with hot wallets or using cloud computing to store data \u2013 being a \u2018technology\u2019 risk), the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\n\nh)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA expects all Authorised Persons to have fully compliant Client on-boarding processes.  Virtual Assets have been criticised by regulatory bodies globally due to their (pseudo-)anonymity features, which makes tracking Client records and transactions more challenging for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers.\n\ni)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nCustomer Risk Assessment and \u2018Customer Due Diligence\u2019 (\u201cCDD\u201d) policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons. Authorised Persons should have a process to assess and rate all their Clients according to that Client\u2019s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Persons\u2019 RBA). This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client. Authorised Persons must undertake CDD for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons to use simplified CDD when conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, largely due to issues surrounding the (pseudo-) anonymity of Clients and transactions associated with Virtual Assets.\n\nj)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nIn the case of non-face-to-face on-boarding and ongoing due diligence of Clients who are natural persons, the FSRA expects that an Authorised Person will develop appropriate policies to ensure that the Client\u2019s identity is duly verified in accordance with all applicable Laws and Rules. This may include obtaining a \u201cselfie\u201d or by conducting a \u201cliveness test\u201d. Irrespective of the method employed, it should validate that the individual being on-boarded is present during the on-boarding process, matches the individual in the identity documentation, and that the ID presented is valid and authentic. It should also include obtaining and authenticating a valid form of the Client\u2019s facial ID, which should be either the Client\u2019s passport with all applicable details clear and, or the original version (front and back) of an official government issued document, such as a national ID or driver\u2019s license. For the purposes of residents of the UAE, the primary form of documentation used should be the Client\u2019s Emirates ID card.\n\nk)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA understands that Authorised Persons may need to use new technology to improve Client on-boarding processes for the purpose of assessing and managing ML and TF risks.  For example, in order for Authorised Persons to conduct non-face-to-face on-boarding they will need to implement facial recognition software to validate the \u201cselfie\u201d against the other uploaded documentation, or other suitable biometric technology.\n\nl)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA further understands that the proper use of such technologies (e.g., fingerprinting, retinal/eye scans, use of real-time video conference facilities to enable facial recognition) can assist with mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client\u2019s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\n\nm)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\n\n\nn)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\no)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\n\np)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and maintain effective transactional monitoring systems to determine the origin of a Virtual Asset and to monitor its destination, and to apply strong \u201cknow your transaction\u201d measures which enable Authorised Persons to have complete granular data centric information about the transactions done by a Client.\n\nq)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants transacting with Virtual Assets that may have been tainted in any way from an illegal activity.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person\u2019s internal processes establish the types of \u2018indicators\u2019 or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Virtual Assets may have been used in an illegal manner.  An Authorised Person should have a process for the management of when such \u2018indicators\u2019 (for example, certain Client or use of \u201cmixer\u201d and \u201ctumbler\u201d services) are triggered.\n\nr)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nWhile the FSRA cannot recommend particular vendors or providers, all technology solutions must be fit for purpose and Authorised Persons should consider using those with an established track record, and undertake their own due diligence/risk assessment to ensure competency and capability.  The FSRA recognises that many of the (technology) solutions appropriate for mitigating Virtual Asset risks are continuing to be developed within the Virtual Asset industry itself.\n\ns)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and adhere to a \u201cVirtual Asset Compliance Policy\u201d, tailored to meet specific Virtual Asset business compliance requirements, and reflecting a clear comprehension of the Authorised Person\u2019s understanding of its compliance responsibilities.  The FSRA expects this policy to be well defined, comprehensive, robust and as specific to an individual Authorised Person\u2019s activities as possible. The policy can be separate or part of other compliance policies/manuals.\n\nt)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nFollowing the development of the Virtual Asset Compliance Policy, Authorised Persons\u2019 compliance officers are expected to establish a \u201cVirtual Asset compliance monitoring program\u201d, requiring internal reviews to be conducted in an efficient way, and on a periodic basis.\n\nu)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\nAuthorised Persons must appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (\u201cMLRO\u201d) who will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Authorised Person\u2019s compliance with the AML Rules.  Consistent with the FSRA\u2019s expectation in relation to all other Authorised Persons, an MLRO should have an appropriate level of seniority and independence in order to be effective in the role.\n\nv)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons should familiarise themselves with their reporting obligations under the AML Rules, in particular in relation to the reporting of suspicious activities/transactions.\n\nw)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nPrior to commencing operations, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to establish online connectivity with the UAE\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit for the purposes of submitting Suspicious Activity Reports (\u201cSARs\u201d). Instructions on how to do this can be found on the FSRA\u2019s FCPU webpage.\n\nx)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting obligations\nAuthorised Persons are required to establish sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to detect possible ML and TF activities. Systems should also be implemented to effectively identify any attempt to breach domestic and international sanctions. Such systems may rely on new technological solutions (including monitoring algorithms or Artificial Intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d)).\n\ny)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nAs proper documentation is one of the main pillars of ensuring AML/CFT compliance, Authorised Persons are required to have policies and procedures in place to ensure proper record keeping practices. It is expected that an Authorised Person will maintain up to date records in accordance with the CDD obligations applicable to it and be prepared to provide the records upon request from the FSRA.\n\nz)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA understands that the transaction recording of many Virtual Asset transactions is linked to, or based on, DLT. This requires an Authorised Person to implement specific arrangements to ensure that, at a minimum, the Authorised Person and the FSRA have access to all relevant information as necessary. An Authorised Person may use a distributed ledger to store its data, provided it is able to provide this data, in an easily accessible format, to the FSRA when required.\n\naa)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nThe FSRA views Virtual Asset activities that are linked to cash transactions as posing higher ML and TF risks, due to the source of funding being significantly more difficult to determine. Authorised Persons wishing to conduct cash transactions will be required to implement enhanced controls to mitigate the inherent risks of such transactions. Such controls may include, among other things, setting appropriate limits on cash deposits (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly limits), a prohibition on receiving cash directly, prohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\n\nbb)\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.  An Authorised Person\u2019s activities are expected to be in compliance with the AML Rules, ensuring that their activities do not pose a regulatory risk or reputational damage to the ADGM Financial System.\n",

        "Passage": "MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nGuidance in relation to Applicable Rules\nChapter 8 of COBS incorporates Rules from various other FSRA Rulebooks that must be complied with, including certain sections of MIR. COBS Rule 8.2.1 sets out various Rules in MIR that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) are required to comply with to the satisfaction of the FSRA, with the applicable Rules set out as follows:\n\na)\tMIR Rule 2.6 (Operational systems and controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to \u2018establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.\u2019\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its \u2018MTF\u2019 activities in compliance with these operational system and control requirements, in combination with the technology governance controls outlined earlier in this Guidance.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake extensive due diligence and testing of its operational systems and controls, with the relevant reports of such testing capable of being provided to the FSRA for review.  Such testing should be undertaken by an officer of the MTF possessing appropriate skills and experience.  The testing reports need to confirm the robustness of the MTF\u2019s systems and address any potential areas of failure.  Testing should include the settlement processes for the movement of Virtual Assets between wallets, and the general connectivity of the MTF\u2019s systems with other parties.  Testing should be ongoing, building in processes for the introduction of new Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\niii.\tAn MTF will need to provide policies and procedures that clearly evidence how it will effectively address a failure of its systems.  Failures must be rectified as soon as practicable, with an MTF\u2019s business continuity plan including detailed and realistic response timeframes for failures or disruptions.\n\nb)\tMIR Rules 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 (Transaction recording):  FSRA expects that the primary ledger technology systems and controls of an MTF (whether they be DLT or multiple-ledger technologies) will be such that transaction recording and reporting is easily facilitated, and that all FSRA requirements can be effectively complied with.  Where reconciliations are required to be undertaken, for example, between a DLT based ledger and an internal ledger maintained by an MTF for the purposes of transactions and/or settlement, the FSRA will need to be satisfied that the reconciliation process is robust, timely and efficient.\n\nc)\tMIR Rule 2.8 (Membership criteria and access):  MIR Rule 2.8.1 requires that an MTF \u2018must ensure that access to its facilities is subject to criteria designed to protect the orderly functioning of the market and the interests of investors\u2019.\n\nAccess Requirements\n\ni.\tMIR Rules 2.8.2, 2.8.3, 2.8.5 and 2.8.6 support the operation of MIR Rule 2.8.1, and the FSRA expects that MTFs consider the application of the requirements across these Rules - for example, MIR Rule 2.8.5 contains substantive provisions that should apply, regardless of what model of \u2018access\u2019 an MTF (using Virtual Assets) utilises.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA recognises, however, that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) generally operate an \u2018access\u2019 model that does not include Members  (e.g., access is granted directly to (retail and institutional) Clients of the MTF).  An MTF operating in this manner will, therefore, need to ensure that it has appropriate processes, controls and rules to \u2018protect the orderly functioning\u2019 of its market, its facilities and the interests of its investors.\n\niii.\tBy not adopting a \u2018Member-access\u2019 model and allowing direct \u2018Client-access\u2019, MTFs lose one layer of regulatory/supervisory defense that Recognised Investment Exchanges and Member-access MTFs have, in that they do not have Members assisting them in the undertaking of the necessary due diligence and compliance reviews of investors being on-boarded into their market.  The FSRA, in these circumstances, requires MTFs to undertake their own CDD reviews for every client accessing (trading on) their market (something which traditionally a Recognised Investment Exchange or Member-access MTF can rely on its Members to do). Resultant AML/CFT obligations therefore fall more directly on a Client-access MTF as well.\n\niv.\tThe FSRA expects that the controls (and resultant resourcing needs) of an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately regulated (including for AML purposes).  An MTF may not, however, take such comfort when its institutional Clients may come from unregulated/less regulated jurisdictions. MTFs with an institutional Client base will therefore need to demonstrate how the MTF will adequately comply with the requirements of the AML Rulebook where its institutional Clients are trading on behalf of further clients.\n\nv.\tGiven the current lack of global regulation of Virtual Asset intermediaries, those MTFs operating a \u2018membership model\u2019 will need to assess whether their members are adequately regulated in their home jurisdiction, such that the MTF can suitably rely on their Members, for example, to undertake CDD/AML checks.  Where members are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their \u2018members\u2019 for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website of the MTF.\n\nviii.\tSupporting documents such as participation agreements, terms of business, product lists, user guides and technical specifications are also a key part of the operation of an MTF, and should be consistent with its rulebook.  The FSRA does not consider that the existence of these documents alone meet the requirement of having a transparent and effective rulebook.  The FSRA considers it good practice that these supporting documents are available and transparent, alongside the published rulebook, to the extent possible.\n\nix.\tThe content of a rulebook  should enable an MTF to demonstrate how it is complying with MIR Rule 2.8, be supported by procedures that are complete and clear, and all in support of an MTF seeking to ensure that behaviour within its market is fair and orderly.\n\nx.\tThe FSRA expects MTFs to require explicit acknowledgement via a user agreement, that participants have read, understood and will abide by the rulebook at all times.\n\nxi.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake regular reviews of its rulebook to ensure it is consistent with relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.  Best practice may see such activity undertaken no less than every twelve-months.\n\nd)\tMIR Rule 2.9 (Financial crime and market abuse):  MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor, detect and prevent conduct amounting to market misconduct and/or Financial Crime. Given the significant risks, and the nascent nature and constant pace of development of the Virtual Asset industry, an MTF\u2019s surveillance system will need to be robust, and regularly reviewed and enhanced.\n\ni.\tThe FSRA recognises that an MTF outside ADGM may not be subject to a similar regulatory standard as that which applies within ADGM.  The FSRA recommends, therefore, that MTFs spend the time to consider the application of MIR Rules 2.9.1 to 2.9.3, which technology, systems and controls they propose to use for these purposes, and the associated resourcing needs required to undertake these functions appropriately.  For this reason, among others set out in this Guidance, the FSRA is of the view that it is not appropriate for an MTF to outsource its compliance / market surveillance functions.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA further reminds MTFs, and investors trading on an MTF, of the Market Abuse provisions applicable to the trading of Accepted Virtual Assets on an MTF.\n\ne)\tMIR Rule 2.11 (Rules and consultation): To meet MIR Rules 2.11.1 to 2.11.11, an MTF must ensure that it has appropriate procedures in place for it to make rules, for keeping its rules under review, for consulting and for amending its rules.  MIR Rule 2.11.2 requires proposed rule changes be subject to FSRA approval.\n\nf)\tMIR Rule 3.3 (Fair and orderly trading): MIR Rules 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 establish the requirements an MTF must meet for providing fair and orderly trading across its market, and for having objective criteria for the efficient execution of orders.  The FSRA considers these requirements to be fundamental to the operation of an MTF.\n\ng)\tCOBS Rule 8.3.1 & MIR Rule 3.7 (Public disclosure):\n\ni.\tAny arrangements of an MTF used to make information public (including trading information required to be disclosed under COBS Rule 8.3.1) must satisfy a number of conditions, including that it is reliable, monitored continuously, and made available to the public on a non-discriminatory basis. While an MTF can choose the format structure to be used for dissemination, MIR Rule 3.7.4 requires it to conform to a consistent and structured format.\n\nii.\tIn terms of the timing of disclosure of MTF trading information, the FSRA recognises that current virtual asset industry practice is for such trading information to be released on a real-time basis (in alignment with current practice for trading within spot commodity markets, but different to the current industry/regulatory practice of delayed data within certain securities/derivatives markets).  The FSRA is not proposing any additional specific requirements at this stage (to those already applicable in COBS Rule 8.3.1 and MIR Rule 3.7), but will continue to monitor industry practice.\n\nh)\tMIR Rule 3.8 (Settlement and Clearing Services): An MTF will need to have clear processes in place for the settlement (and if applicable, the clearing) of all Accepted Virtual Asset transactions.  As noted in the AML and Technology Governance sections of this Guidance, extensive stress testing on capabilities to connect successfully with third parties, and in relation to the movement of Accepted Virtual Assets between wallets, will be required to be undertaken to the FSRA\u2019s satisfaction.  The FSRA will not necessarily require a connection to a separate Recognised (or Remote) Clearing House where the MTF can demonstrate that it has in place \u2018satisfactory arrangements for the timely discharge, Clearing and settlement of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions effected\u2019 on the MTF, including where it is utilising the services of a Virtual Asset Custodian.\n\ni)\tMIR Rule 3.10 (Default Rules): Depending on whether an MTF operates a \u2018Member-access\u2019 model or it allows direct \u2018Client-access\u2019 will determine the full, or partial, application of MIR Rules 3.10.1 to 3.10.3.  The FSRA, at a minimum, expects MTFs to have in place both rules and a process to suspend or terminate access to its markets in circumstances where a Client/Member is unable to meet its obligations in respect of transactions relating to Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\ni.\tThe FSRA suggests that an Applicant/Authorised Person consider different scenarios/circumstances where it may need to utilise the powers provided to it under its Default Rules, and take appropriate action as required.  Scenario testing of this kind could relate to when there is a financial and/or technical \u2018default\u2019 in relation to, for example, its custody, fiat token or wider banking arrangements. Due to a prevalence of pre-funding of (client) positions within Virtual Asset markets, the impact of a \u2018default\u2019 in such a scenario may not necessarily be on a per-transaction basis, but could be structural in nature, in limiting the ability of Clients to fund their positions (and therefore the ability of the MTF to operate on a fair and orderly basis).\n\nii.\tTo prepare for the event of a loss/default, the FSRA expects an MTF to have, within its policies, a clear process for the management of such loss (e.g., what is the exposure of individual Clients, counterparties, its Custodian and itself, as applicable).\n\n",

Such an arrangement includes scenarios where an MTF provides its own in-house proprietary wallet for Clients to store any Accepted Virtual Assets bought through that exchange or transferred into the wallet from other sources. Type 1 also includes firms who solely provide the dedicated service of helping Clients (such as MTFs, broker-dealers, traders, fund / asset managers) custodise their Accepted Virtual Assets. The Type 1 custody provider effectively holds Virtual Assets (e.g., the private keys) as an agent on behalf of Clients and has control over these Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\nb)\tType 2 (Outsourced Custodial Wallet): The Authorised Person is wholly responsible for the custody of a Client\u2019s Accepted Virtual Assets but operationally outsources this function to a third-party Virtual Asset custodian. Type 2 arrangements include the scenario where an MTF uses a third party custody service provider to hold its Clients\u2019 Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\nc)\tType 3 (Non-Custodial / Self-Custody Wallet): The Authorised Person allows/requires Clients to wholly \u201cself-custodise\u201d their Accepted Virtual Assets, and at no point does the Authorised Person have partial or full control over these Clients\u2019 Virtual Assets. The Type 3 custody provider is typically a third-party hardware or software company that offers the means for each Client to hold their Virtual Assets (and fully control private keys) themselves. Hardware wallets, mobile wallets, desktop wallets and paper wallets are generally examples of non-custodial wallets. Clients using non-custodial wallets have full control of and sole responsibility for their Virtual Assets, and the non-custodial wallet provider does not have the ability to effect unilateral transfers of Clients\u2019 Virtual Assets without Clients\u2019 authorisation.\n",
