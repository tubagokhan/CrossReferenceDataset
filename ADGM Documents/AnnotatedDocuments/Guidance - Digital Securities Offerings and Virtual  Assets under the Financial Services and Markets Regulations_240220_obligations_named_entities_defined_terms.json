Below are the detailed descriptions of each:\n\nOther Digital Tokens: These are utility tokens which do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment/instrument under FSRA.\n\nVirtual Assets: This category includes non-fiat virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, etc. The figure notes that FSRA's market intermediaries conducting Virtual Asset business are required to apply and hold the relevant license under FSRA.\n\nDigital Securities: Described as digital assets with security characteristics, including 'tokenized' offerings of securities. Financial services activities in relation to Security Tokens - e.g., the offering of, dealing in, advising on, custody of, or providing Security Tokens - are regulated as Security instruments under FSRA.\n\nFiat Tokens: These are digital tokens that are fully backed by fiat currency. Some activities where tokens are used as payment instruments, e.g., stablecoins, may be regulated as Providing Money Services under FSRA.\n\nDerivatives/Funds: This refers to Derivatives over regulated Digital Assets and collective investment funds investing in Regulated Digital Assets. They are regulated as Derivatives and Funds in a Fund under FSRA.\n\nMarket operators and intermediaries dealing in such Derivatives and Funds are licensed and approved by FSRA.\n\nThe bottom note clarifies that the FSRA regulates and will allow to operate within the ADGM, the Digital Assets located within the blue dotted line and Derivatives over/Funds investing in Digital Assets. The blue dotted line encapsulates all categories except \"Other Digital Tokens,\" implying that all the other categories fall under the regulatory scope of FSRA within the ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market).\n/Figure End",
