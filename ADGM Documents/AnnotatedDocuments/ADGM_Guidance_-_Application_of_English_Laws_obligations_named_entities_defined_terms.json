The ADGM courts are also specifically empowered to make any necessary adaptations for the specific circumstances of the ADGM.  The result is that the entire, constantly-updated corpus of English common law case law provides valuable precedent to the ADGM. While it is very unlikely that any two cases would be exactly the same, the body of precedent provides predictability to the law.  ADGM\u2019s courts will refer to relevant precedents and reason from those to determine the application of the law to the facts in front of them. They are additionally empowered to depart entirely from the common law precedents where the circumstances of ADGM require. It is envisaged that such departures will be rare given the likely commercial flavour of most disputes (where the common law\u2019s international standards are likely to be appropriate to ADGM) and because similar provisions have been applied sparingly in other jurisdictions where this sort of carve-out has been adopted.",

ADGM has produced consolidated versions of the 47 English statutes as modified which are scheduled to the Application Regulations for ease of use. As these statutes have been implemented locally and consistently with their UK form, they should benefit from the existing English case law that interprets and applies analogous provisions. As ADGM\u2019s other enactments have also been drafted from precedent statutes from the UK and other commercially renowned jurisdictions they inherit the precedential value of common law cases interpreting and applying those statutes, which can usefully be considered in the ADGM courts.\n(ii)\tImprovements: ADGM has, in its individual reflection of precedent statutes from the UK and other common law jurisdictions, made useful improvements and modifications which businesses and practitioners in ADGM may find it worth familiarising themselves with. ADGM\u2019s improvements and modifications have been clearly identified in the relevant legislative consultation papers which are publicly available online. For example the following concepts have been omitted in ADGM\u2019s Companies and Insolvency Regulations: (i) memoranda of association; (ii) share nominal value; and (iii) company voluntary arrangements.  Other improvements made include the addition of \u201crestricted scope companies\u201d, \u201ccell companies\u201d and removals of restrictions on returning capital to limited partners in limited liability partnerships.
