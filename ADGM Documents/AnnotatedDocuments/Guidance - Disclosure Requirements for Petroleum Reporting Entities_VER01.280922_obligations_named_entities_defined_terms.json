The following circumstances, therefore, are important to note:\n\na)\tIf an Issuer was seeking to make a Prospectus Offer within ADGM, but was not seeking to be listed and traded within ADGM, then depending on where the listing and trading is to occur, the FSRA may not view the entity as having the required \u2018investor protection\u2019 and \u2018disclosure\u2019 protections in place, and therefore may not be in a position to form a view that it can approve the Prospectus under Rule 4.6.2.  In such circumstance, it may be the FSRA\u2019s general view that the Issuer (or relevant entity) should also seek admission to the Official List of Securities and admission to trading on an RIE;\n\nb)\tIf an issuer was seeking to make a prospectus offer outside ADGM, and then seeking to be listed and traded within ADGM, then depending on where the listing and trading was to occur the FSRA may not view the issuer as having made an offer of securities that is equivalent to those made under and in compliance with the requirements of the Rules.  The FSRA may, therefore, also form a view that it is not in a position to approve an admission to the Official List of Securities (under section 50(2) of FSMR) due to the offer having adequate \u2018investor protection\u2019 and \u2018disclosure\u2019 protections in place.
