This was mainly attributable to lower finance costs of $[\u25cf] million due to lower interest rates and lower loan principals.\n\u2022\tOur net cash generated from operating activities decreased by $[\u25cf] million from $[\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\u25cf] million in [year] due to an increase in credit sales that contributed to an increase in trade receivables of $[\u25cf] million from $[\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\u25cf] million in [year].\n\u2022\tOur net assets increased by $[\u25cf] million from $[\u25cf] million in [year] to $[\u25cf] million in [year] mainly due to the $[\u25cf] million increase in inventories for our new product introduced in [year].\n\nThe above factors are not the only factors contributing to our financial performance in FY[\u25cf] and FY[\u25cf]. Please refer to the other factors set out in pages [\u25cf] to [\u25cf] of the Offer document.\n\nINVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nWHAT ARE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PLANS?\n[Briefly describe the Issuer\u2019s or the Group\u2019s (as the case may be) key strategies and future plans for the development of its business]\n\nExample:\n\nKey Strategies and Future Plans\n\nWe have a well-established brand name in [country] and we are recognised as the leading manufacturing company of [principal business] in [country]. We have a strong management team with over 20 years of experience in the industry and the management team has contributed significantly to our Company\u2019s growth and expansion since our incorporation in [year]. We aim to strengthen our position in this industry and region by expanding our operations to [names of countries] in the next 3 years.\n\nWe have also recently started a joint venture with [name of company] to enter into the [secondary business] market. We believe that there is a growing market for [secondary business] in [country] given the changing lifestyles of consumers in [country].\n\n\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our strategies and future plans.\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY TRENDS, UNCERTANTIES, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS OR EVENTS WHICH ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON US?\n[Where applicable, briefly discuss, for at least the current financial year, the Issuer\u2019s or the Group\u2019s (as the case may be) business and financial prospects, any significant recent trends in production, sales and inventory, and in the costs and selling prices of products and services, as well as any other known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Issuer or the Group (as the case may be). If there are no such trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events, provide an appropriate statement to that effect.]\n\nExample:\n\nFor the current financial year, our Directors have observed the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources of the Group, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Group:\n\n(a)\tthe demand for [activity] has increased with the recent growth [country]\u2019s economy. We expect our revenue from our [business segment] to increase in line with the increase in [activity]; and\n\n(b)\twe expect the upward trend in [activity] to have a positive impact on the demand for our [service].\n\nOperating costs are also expected to increase together with the increase in the level of [activity].\n\nThe above are not the only trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that could affect us. Please refer to the other factors set out in pages [\u25cf] to [\u25cf] of the Offer document.\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our business and financial prospects.\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY RISKS WHICH HAD MATERIALLY AFFECTED OR COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT US AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES?\n[Discuss the key risks which the Issuer considers to be the most important for the investor when deciding whether or not he should invest in the shares/units being offered, taking into account the possibility of the risk occurring and/or whether the event will have a material adverse impact on the Issuer\u2019s or the Group\u2019s business operations, financial position and results, and the investor\u2019s investment in the shares/units. The Issuer should not set out the entire list of risk factors found in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Offer document.]\n\nExample:\n\nKEY RISKS\n\nWe consider the following to be the most important key risks which had materially affected or could materially affect our business operations, financial position and results, and your investment in our shares.\n\n\u2022\tAn economic downturn could negatively affect our profitability: Our industry is exposed to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty of future economic prospects. Economic downturns could have an adverse impact on overall demand. This would result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\n\n\u2022\tOur industry is highly competitive: We compete against numerous businesses and our competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources. We compete for customers, financing, employees and other resources. This creates both strong price and quality competition, which leads to increased costs in the form of marketing and customer services, in addition to price reductions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on several factors, including our market presence, our reputation, our competitors, and general trends in the industry and economy. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully.\n\n\u2022\tA substantial proportion of our revenues is derived from several major customers and loss of their business may seriously impact our financial results: Our five largest customers accounted for approximately [\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year], and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately [\u25cf]% of our revenues for the year ended [year]. Our revenues may significantly decrease if we lose any of these customers or if our customers reduce their volume of business with us.\n\n\u2022\tWe face risks associated with our business being conducted in [country]: As most of our operations are conducted in [country], our business may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage inherent risks including: unexpected political or economic developments; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unfavourable tax consequences; adverse legal or regulatory changes; insufficient protection for intellectual property rights; and complexities relating to currency and capital transfers.\n\n\u2022\tThe restrictions on our operating subsidiary\u2019s ability to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund and operate our business: We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in [country]. Accordingly, we will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, service any debt we may incur, and pay any dividends that may be declared. The payment of dividends by [country] entities such as our subsidiaries is subject to limitations in accordance with the rules and regulations of [country], which may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\n\nThe above are not the only risk factors that had a material effect or could have a material effect on our business operations, financial position and results, and your shares. Refer to \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for a discussion on other risk factors and for more information on the above risk factors. Prior to making a decision to invest in our [shares/units], you should consider all the information contained in the Offer document.\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on risk factors.\nWHAT ARE THE RIGHTS ATTACHED TO THE SECURITIES OFFERED?\n[Describe the type and class of shares/units being offered, including the rights attached to the shares/units and any restrictions on the free transferability of shares/units.]\n\nExample:\n\nKey Information on Shares Offered\n\nAs of the date of this Offer document, our issued and paid up share capital was $[\u25cf] consisting of [\u25cf] shares.\n\nWe have only one class of shares, and the shares offered will have the same rights as our other existing issued and paid-up shares, including voting rights. Shareholders will be entitled to all rights attached to their shares in proportion to their shareholding, such as any cash dividends declared by the Company and any distribution of assets upon liquidation of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transferability of our shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information.\n\nHOW WILL THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFER BE USED?\n[Provide information on the amount of proceeds raised from the offer will be allocated to each principal intended use. Information on the use of proceeds should be presented using diagrams (e.g. tables, graphs and charts) where appropriate.]\n\nExample:\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nThe net proceeds to be raised in the offer (after deducting estimated expenses to be borne by us) is $[\u25cf]. The following represents our estimate of the allocation of the gross proceeds expected to be raised from the offer, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by vendors.\n\nDetails of utilisation\t$ (million)\tAllocation for each $1.00 gross proceeds raised\n(1)\tNet proceeds:\n(a)\tExpansion of business\n\n(b)\tWorking capital and general corporate purposes\t[\u25cf]\n\n[\u25cf]\t[\u25cf]\n\n[\u25cf]\n(2)\tOther estimated expenses\t[\u25cf]\t[\u25cf]\nTotal\t[\u25cf]\t1.00\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our use of proceeds.\nWILL WE BE PAYING [DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS] AFTER THE OFFER?\n[Describe (i) the dividends/distributions per share/unit, if any, paid by the Issuer for each of the 3 most recent completed financial years, and (ii) the Issuer\u2019s dividend/distribution policy, or if it does not have a fixed policy, to state so. Provide clear and prominent disclosure of any existing or proposed arrangement that materially enhances short-term yields while potentially diluting long-term yields. The disclosure should include a computation of the forecast distribution yield assuming that the arrangements are not in place.]\n\nExample:\n\nOver the last three financial years ended 31 December [year], [year] and [year], we have not declared and distributed dividends. We currently do not have a fixed dividend policy. Any future payment of dividends by us would depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors. If we do not pay any dividends, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our shares, and our shares may be less valuable because return on investment will depend entirely on capital appreciation.\nRefer to the \u201c[relevant section]\u201d on page(s) [\u25cf] of the Offer document for more information on our [dividend / distribution] policy.\nDEFINITIONS\n[Provide definitions if necessary.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nWHO CAN YOU CONTACT IF YOU HAVE ENQUIRIES RELATING TO OUR OFFER?\nHOW DO YOU CONTACT US?\n[Provide contact details of Issuer, distributor(s)/underwriter(s) and/or issue manager(s) whom investors can contact if they have enquiries. Include a website address and email address, if appropriate.]\n\n/Table End\n\n",
