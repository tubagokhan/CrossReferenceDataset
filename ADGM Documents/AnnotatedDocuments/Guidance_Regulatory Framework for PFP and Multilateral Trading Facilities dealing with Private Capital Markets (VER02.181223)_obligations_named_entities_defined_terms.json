In particular, the FSRA will consider:\n(i)\tthe nature and structure of the products offered on the PFP;\n(ii)\tthe PFP Applicant\u2019s target Clients;\n(iii)\tthe roles and responsibilities of the PFP Applicant;\n(iv)\twhether the Applicant will carry out primary and/or secondary trading;\n(v)\twhether the PFP Applicant might have any perceived conflicts of interest when authorised and how these might be managed;\n(vi)\tany proposed outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers;\n(vii)\twhether the PFP Applicant is proposing to carry out any other Regulated Activities; and\n(viii)\tthe safekeeping arrangements for Client Assets if the PFP Applicant intends to hold these.\nIn the case that a PFP Applicant proposes to carry out other Regulated Activities such as Operating a MTF, Advising on Investments or Credit, Managing Assets or Managing a Collective Investment Fund, the PFP Applicant would need to demonstrate how it would manage any potential conflicts of interest that these activities may pose.\n(b)\tTrack Record\nA PFP Applicant should demonstrate that it or its Group has an established track record in corporate finance or a related business, of a minimum of five years, in a jurisdiction that has a legislative and regulatory framework that is of comparable standard to that of the FSRA. The PFP Applicant or its Group, where applicable, should also be subject to proper supervision by a competent regulatory authority.\nAlternatively, where a PFP Applicant does not have an established track-record of at least five years or meet the regulatory status requirement, the FSRA may take into account (i) the track record of the PFP Applicant\u2019s Controllers/substantial shareholders and (ii) the experience and qualifications of the PFP Applicant\u2019s key individuals, when assessing the application.\n(c)\tGoverning Body\n(i)\tLicensed Directors \u2013 A PFP Applicant which is a Body Corporate incorporated in the ADGM, must register all its Directors with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.4.\n(ii)\tLicensed Partners \u2013 A PFP Applicant which is Partnership established in the ADGM, must register all its Partners with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.5.\nThese appointments are not required for PFP Applicants that are branches of legal entities domiciled outside the ADGM.\nThe PFP Applicant must demonstrate that its Governing Body has sufficient collective skills and experience in corporate finance or related fields to oversee the firm\u2019s operations.\n(d)\tMandatory Appointments\nA PFP Applicant must also appoint the following individuals in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.1:\n(i)\tSenior Executive Officer (\u201cSEO\u201d) \u2013 an SEO who is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation, supervision and control of the firm\u2019s operation.

As a minimum the risk warning should address the risks set out in section 2.3 of this Guidance.\nPrior to registering a Client to access the PFP, a PFP Operator must obtain their acknowledgement that they fully understand the risks set out in the risk warning.\n(b)\tDue Diligence\nThe PFP Operator is required to undertake appropriate and proportionate due diligence on a PFP Prospect covering the matters set out in COBS Section 18.4, as a minimum. Where reasonable and prudent, the due diligence review of a PFP Prospect may require independent verification.\nA PFP Operator is not required to disclose its due diligence assessments to Clients, although it may choose to do so. However, it is required to disclose and explain in a clear way its selection and acceptance criteria for a PFP Transaction to be offered on its platform. It must also disclose its due diligence methodology for each of its criterion including where the due diligence is undertaken by a third party.\nA PFP Operator must keep records of the due diligence undertaken on all PFP Prospects for the FSRA\u2019s review.\nA PFP Operator must also form a reasonable basis for believing that the PFP Prospect has adequately set out relevant information regarding its proposal in a clear, fair and not misleading manner for Clients to make an informed decision including, but not limited to:\n(i)\tgeneral information about the PFP Prospect including details of its incorporation, commercial licence, directorships, major shareholders, beneficial holders;\n(ii)\tthe business proposal and business model;\n(iii)\tfinancial information about the PFP Prospect;\n(iv)\tcriteria by which the PFP Transaction would be regarded as being in default;\n(v)\ta wind-down plan, including information on the return of Client Assets, in the event of business default/failure of the PFP Prospect;\n(vi)\tfeatures, structures, and subscription classes of the PFP Transaction;\n(vii)\tbasis of subscription class and allotment to each Client;\n(viii)\ttreatment, voting / contractual rights and claims of Clients of the PFP Transaction in any particular subscription class;\n(ix)\tpricing and valuation basis of the PFP Transaction;\n(x)\trisks specific to the PFP Prospect and PFP Transaction;\n(xi)\tparties involved in the PFP Transaction and any conflicts of interest, including any financial or other interests that the PFP Operator, its key officers, Employees and Associates have in the PFP Prospect or PFP Transaction;\n(xii)\tprocedures and obligations for Clients in any administrative / corporate actions;\n(xiii)\twhether the PFP Prospect is seeking funding from other sources at the same time;\n(xiv)\tintended use of funds;\n(xv)\ttreatment of oversubscriptions and maximum amount accepted, if applicable;\n(xvi)\tany cancellation rights;\n(xvii)\tformat / frequency of performance reporting to Clients; and\n(xviii)\tformat / frequency of ongoing disclosure of applicable information in relation to the PFP Transaction and PFP Prospect.\nAny material changes to the information disclosed in the proposal to Clients must be updated and notified to Clients within a reasonable timeframe and at least ten business days prior to closing of the PFP Transaction.\n(c)\tForums / Message Boards\nA PFP Operator is not required to comply with the above disclosure requirements where it is merely gauging the interest of Clients on a potential PFP Transaction where the related start-up or SME is not identified.\nIn such instances, the PFP Operator should monitor the forum or message board used to gauge Client interest to remove any potentially misleading or fraudulent posts.\n(d)\tMarketing\nAs access to PFPs is restricted to registered Clients only, mass solicitation, advertising or canvassing of the PFP Transaction is not permitted.\nHowever, a PFP Operator may promote its platform to the general public. Such communication may include general information about the PFP Operator, its business model and the PFP Prospects accepted on its platform. Such communication should not include any information on specific offers, research or recommendations relating to a PFP Prospect or a PFP transaction.\n(e)\tDisclosure\nA PFP Operator must disclose the following information to its Clients, either in written form or electronically through the PFP, to enable them to make an informed decision on whether to participate in a transaction on the PFP:\n\n(i)\thow the PFP operates (e.g. whether it offers loan or investment based financing opportunities, the process for participating in a financing opportunity; how Client Assets are held, how transactions through the PFP may be structured);\n(ii)\tthe PFP Operator\u2019s remuneration model (e.g. whether the PFP Operator is remunerated entirely by PFP Prospects by a percentage of funds raised or on a transaction basis by its Clients);\n(iii)\tthe PFP Operator\u2019s roles and obligations (including to Clients in any administrative / corporate actions in relation to the PFP Transactions).
