Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets
The principal Rules for Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets are set out in Chapter 17 of the FSRA Conduct of Business Rulebook (COBS).  These product specific Rules apply in addition to any other Rules applicable to the Regulated Activity being conducted by Authorised Person (e.g., Operating a Multilateral Trading Facility, Providing Custody or Dealing). Though the requirements set out in COBS Rule 17.1.2 already apply to Authorised Persons generally, COBS Rule 17.1.2 operates as a sign-post Rule designed to draw the attention of Authorised Persons conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets to the fact that they must comply with all Rules applicable to Authorised Persons, including:

a)	all other relevant chapters of COBS;

b)	the FSRA General Rulebook (GEN);

c)	the FSRA Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance (AML); and

COBS Rule 17.1.3 operates such that Client Investments in GEN and Financial Instruments in CMC are read to include Virtual Assets.

Accepted Virtual Assets
COBS Rule 17.2.1 permits an Authorised Person to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Accepted Virtual Assets only.

Accepted Virtual Assets
An Accepted Virtual Asset may be deemed suitable for use by more than one Authorised Person, subject to each Authorised Person satisfying the FSRA that it can meet the regulatory requirements in respect of the specific Accepted Virtual Asset.  For example, an MTF using Virtual Assets is required by COBS Rule 17.7.4  to notify the FSRA of any new Accepted Virtual Asset proposed to be admitted to trading on its facilities.  Though the MTF may propose to admit to trading a commonly used and traded Virtual Asset, the MTFs controls, for example, relating to identity/transaction monitoring of a certain distributed ledger may not yet be fully developed. In such circumstances, the FSRA may require the MTF to delay the commencement of trading until such time that suitable controls have been developed and implemented.

An Authorised Person wishing to use a Virtual Asset(s) additional to the Accepted Virtual Asset(s) originally approved as part of its application process, must first seek the FSRAs approval before offering it to Clients.  This application should be made in writing and include all relevant information relating to the use of the Virtual Asset, including the relevant controls the Authorised Person has in place (or if not already in place, that it proposes to implement), in order to manage any risks specific to the Virtual Asset.  In forming a view on the suitability of the proposed Virtual Asset(s), the FSRA will take into account whether the proposed Virtual Asset meets the requirements to be an Accepted Virtual Asset, as set out in COBS Rule 17.2.2 and paragraph 25 of this Guidance.

Pursuant to section 50 of FSMR,  the FSRA is required to maintain the Official List, and may admit to the Official List such Securities as it considers appropriate.  It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own Official List of Securities.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to Market Disclosure or otherwise known as its continuous disclosure framework.  This Guidance sets out the Listing Authoritys expectations in relation to its continuous disclosure framework, and provides guidance to Reporting Entities to assist their decision making in relation to their continuous disclosure obligations.

It should be noted that the test in section 95 of FSMR of whether information is Inside Information is objective, and the fact that a Reporting Entitys officers may genuinely, and honestly, believe that information is not Inside Information, and that therefore it does not need to be Disclosed, will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1, if that view is ultimately found to be incorrect.

When is information Inside Information?
The Listing Authority acknowledges that the various factors of the test for determining whether information is Inside Information may cause some difficulty for Reporting Entities to accurately make this assessment.  In complying with Rule 7.2.1 a Reporting Entity must predict how investors may react to particular information when it is Disclosed.  While in many circumstances this may be obvious, in others circumstances it may not be as clear.  This potential challenge is inescapable, however, as it is the Reporting Entity, and only the Reporting Entity, that can and must form a view as to whether the information of which it is aware (and the rest of the market is not aware of) is Inside Information, and therefore needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1.

An officer of a Reporting Entity who is facing a decision on whether information is Inside Information that needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1 may find it helpful to consider the following three questions:

a)	would this information influence my decision to buy or sell Securities in the Listed Entity at the current market price?

b)	knowing that this information has not been Disclosed, would I feel exposed to an action for Insider Trading if I were to buy or sell Securities in the Listed Entity at their current market price?

c)	if the information is not Disclosed and the price of the Listed Entitys Securities changes once the market becomes aware of the information, would I feel that that the Listed Entity would be exposed to adverse comment or market perception (including from investors, market commentators, litigation funders and other interested stakeholders)?

Assessing, and the context of, Inside Information
In assessing whether or not information is Inside Information, and therefore needs to be disclosed under Rule 7.2.1, the information needs to be considered in context, rather than in isolation, against:

a)	the circumstances affecting the Listed Entity at the time;

b)	any external information that is publicly available at the time; and

The need to assess information in context also means that new Inside Information may need to be Disclosed due to its impact on Inside Information previously Disclosed.  Information that a Listed Entity has, for example, investigated and decided not to pursue a particular business transaction may not be Inside Information, if there was no knowledge or expectation within the market that the Listed Entity was considering the transaction.

In regard to Rule 7.2.1, the first question that an Officer of a Reporting Entity should therefore consider is whether the Reporting Entity is aware of any Inside Information.  If yes, that Officer must consider, immediately,  whether that Inside Information must be Disclosed.

A Listed Entity may receive information about a particular event or circumstance in instalments over time.  In some cases, the initial information about the event or circumstance is such that the Listed Entity cannot reasonably form a view on whether the information constitutes Inside Information and the Listed Entity/Reporting Entity may, therefore, need to wait for further, more complete, information, or make further enquiries, or obtain expert advice, in order to form a view.   In such a case, a Listed Entity will only become aware of Inside Information that needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1 when an Officer has, or ought reasonably to have, come nto possession of sufficient information about the event or circumstance in order to be able to determine it represents Inside Information.

If a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity is in possession of information that constitutes Inside Information, the subjective view of its Officers that it requires further information before it can assess whether the information is Inside Information will not avoid a breach of Rule 7.2.1.  Furthermore, the extension of a Listed Entitys awareness to information that an Officer ought reasonably have come into possession of will require a Listed Entity/Reporting Entity, to make any further enquiries, or to obtain any expert advice, needed to confirm whether the information it has constitutes Inside Information to do so within a reasonable time period.

For example, where a Mining Reporting Entity is required to make a disclosure in relation to mining activities under Rule 7.2.1, the information contained in the disclosure must not only comply with Rule 7.2.1 but also with any applicable Rules within Chapter 11.  The same principle applies in the context of an Issuer making an Offer of Securities within ADGM, such that the Prospectus requirements of Chapter 4 of the Rules, Appendix 1 of the Rules (Content of a Prospectus) and Chapter 11 all apply.

This means that where a Petroleum Reporting Entity is required to make a disclosure in relation to Petroleum activities under Rule 7.2.1, the information contained in the disclosure must not only comply with Rule 7.2.1 but also with any applicable Rules within Chapter 12.

As set out in the ICO Guidance, the FSRAs assessment of whether an offering of a digital/virtual token is regulated under FSMR is conducted on a case-by-case basis (in keeping with FSRAs treatment of conventional Securities).  If a digital/virtual token being offered is assessed to exhibit the (economic and legal) features and characteristics of a Security, the FSRA will deem the digital/virtual token (being a Digital Security) as a Security pursuant to Section 58(2)(b)  of FSMR.  This approach has been taken by the FSRA to ensure the protection of investors, noting that while a Digital Security may have the characteristics of a Security, this position is not always clear and accordingly requires review by the FSRA.

For the purposes of this Guidance and distinct from RCHs, the FSRA will consider DSFs suitable for the purposes of settlement (MIR Rule 3.8) and custody (MIR Rule 2.10) of Digital Securities. A DSF, holding an FSP for Providing Custody, may provide custody and settlement services in Digital Securities for RIEs and MTFs (as applicable).  Therefore, for the purposes of custody and settlement of Digital Securities, the arrangements that a RIE or MTF would normally have in place with a RCH can be replaced with arrangements provided by a DSF, provided that certain requirements, as described in this section, are met.

The FSRA applies the regulatory capital requirements in COBS Rule 22.10 in two different scenarios, such that:

a)	where the Authorised Person is an MTF or OTF, the regulatory capital to be held (under COBS Rule 22.10.1(a) and MIR Rule 3.2.1) is equivalent to 6 months operational expenses ; and

b)	in relation to all other Authorised Persons, the conventional regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Regulated Activities undertaken apply.

Capital Requirements
When applying COBS Rule 22.10 (and, as applicable, MIR Rule 3.2.1) to Authorised Persons, the FSRA will apply proportionality in considering whether any additional capital buffer must be held, based on the size, scope, complexity and nature of the activities and operations of the Authorised Person and, if so, the appropriate amount of regulatory capital required as an additional buffer.  An Authorised Person that the FSRA considers to be high risk may attract higher regulatory capital requirements.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism
In order to develop a robust and sustainable regulatory framework for Spot Commodities, FSRA is of the view that a comprehensive application of its Anti Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism AML/CFT framework should be in place, including full compliance with, among other things:

a)	UAE AML/CFT Federal Laws, including the UAE Cabinet Resolution No. (10) of 2019 Concerning the Executive Regulation of the Federal Law No. (20) of 2018 concerning Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing;

b)	the FSRAs AML Rules or such other AML rules as may be applicable in ADGM from time to time; and

c)	the adoption of international best practices (including with regard to FATF Recommendations).

Public disclosure
Any arrangements of an MTF or OTF used to make information public (including trading information required to be disclosed under MIR Rules 3.5 and 3.6) must satisfy a number of conditions, including that it is reliable, monitored continuously, and made available to the public on a non-discriminatory basis.

Public disclosure
In terms of the timing of disclosure of MTF/OTF trading information, the FSRA recognises that current Spot Commodity industry practice is for such trading information to be released on a discretionary or opaque basis (in alignment with current practice for trading within Spot Commodity markets, but different to the current industry/regulatory practice of delayed data widely seen within Securities/Derivatives markets).  The FSRA is not proposing any additional specific requirements at this stage (to those already applicable in COBS Rule 8.3.1 and MIR Rule 3.7), but will continue to monitor industry practice.

Pursuant to MIR Rule 3.4.1, an RIE may operate an MTF or OTF, provided that its Recognition Order includes a stipulation permitting it to do so.  MIR Rule 3.4.2 requires that where such a stipulation is granted to an RIE, the RIE must meet the requirements of the Spot Commodities Framework in relation to operation of the MTF or OTF (using Spot Commodities) while the remainder of its operations must be operated in compliance with the MIR Rules.

RIEs operating an MTF or OTF using Accepted Spot Commodities
In interpreting COBS Rule 8.2(c), and given the current lack of global regulation of Spot Commodity intermediaries, MTFs or OTFs are permitted to only operate a Membership model in accordance with MIR Rule 2.8.  The MTF/OTF is therefore required to assess whether a potential Member is adequately regulated in its home jurisdiction, such that the MTF or OTF can suitably rely on their Members, for example, to undertake CDD and AML checks.  Where Members are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs or OTFs will have in place additional compliance resources internally (and not be able to rely on their Members for such purposes).
